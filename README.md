# -Credit_Card_Transaction_and_Customer_Analysis
Introduction
We are showing all the data insights and graphs of all the transactions and customer details for 1 year.

All the data can be sorted and viewed through weekly for better convenience.

There are 2 different insights reports for transaction and customer analysis respectively.

Problem Statement
The company wants to better understand their business and wants data insights for all 4 quarters to streamline and focus on the aspects that needs their most attention.

Data Collection
The datasets used for this analysis is a structured data in CSV format and contains 10,109 rows and 18 columns.

Importing The Data
Instead of importing the data straight to Power BI for analysis, I decided to chain the data through an SQL server first. This way, if any new data gets added to the dataset, then all the visualizations will get updated automatically with respect to the new data.

Data Alteration
Before diving into the analysis and visualization, I added some extra columns and measures to make some processes easier. I used the inbuild DAX tool in Power BI to make them.

Dashboard Preparation
I devided the visualization in two parts as well. One for the detailed analysis of all the transaction and the other for all the customers of the company.
